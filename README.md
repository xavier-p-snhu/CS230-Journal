* Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  * The client was a fictional company called The Gaming Room, which had developed a game called Draw It or Lose It for Android. They wanted me to write a software design document to convert the game so that it would work on an internet browser.
* What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  * I feel I identified the strengths and weaknesses of each operating system well.
* What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  * When developing code, I usually have a solid picture of how the software should turn out. Had I needed to share this idea with someone else, a design document would be excellent in communicating this picture.
* If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  * I find that my explanations can sometimes seem confusing to people. In that case, I would have someone peer review my document and provide clarity suggestions.
* How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  * One way I interpreted the user's needs is by considering how I would implement Draw It or Lose It to various operating systems. As every web browser is able to run HTML, making the game work on multiple systems would be easy. However, making it look good is a different story, as mobile devices typically have a different screen size (and orientation) than PC.
* How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  * Object-Oriented Programming is a great strategy for designing software. The principles and guidelines used help to organize your code to be readable and easilly modifiable.
